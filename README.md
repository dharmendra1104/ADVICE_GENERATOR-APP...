## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help us to improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**We complete this Frontend Mentor Challenge using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

**It was fun to make** ðŸš€
